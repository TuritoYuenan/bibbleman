# Bibman - Bibliography Manager

Bibman is a program that manages your bibliography. Users can import an existing bibliography file, add either books, journal articles or webpage documents to their bibliography, then print out the list of these items and export to file.

## Types of Bibliography items

- Book: author, date, title, publisher
- Article: author, date, title, journal, volume, issue, page, doi
- Webpage: author, date, title, website, address

## Usage

This is a CS assignment (and basically a Ruby script) making it not so user friendly

- Have Ruby installed in your computer
- Install the TTY::Prompt library: `gem install tty-prompt`
- In the directory, run `ruby main.rb` to start
